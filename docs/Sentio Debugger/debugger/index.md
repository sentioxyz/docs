To understand a transaction even further, users can use the debugger to visualize the execution line-by-line.

## Traces

On the upper-left section, Sentio shows the trace of the transaction, this is the same as [trace-view](trace-view "mention"). Users can use this to select a location and execute directly to that position.

## Stack Traces

The bottom-left section contains the current call stack information, for example:

## Debug Mode

Sentio has two debug modes, [function-only-mode](function-only-mode "mention") and [single-step-mode](single-step-mode "mention"), while the first one is the default, the latter enables you to examine execution in much greater detail.
