Sentio roughly works as the following

* User A writes the processor code and upload through sentio CLI.
* The processor code is **triggered on user-defined conditions** and executed on Sentio internal infrastructures in **real time (automatically adjusted with chain reorg)**.
* Sentio backfills all the historical data (from contract creation time) and follows the blockchain in real time.
* Processor code emits **Metrics, Event Logs, Entities** that shows up automatically on Sentio UI.
* Processor code could also emit **Webhooks.**
* User A, B, C can build dashboard and alert on top of all the data collected. And create API based on the collected data.
