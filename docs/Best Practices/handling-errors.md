## Time series exceeds 10k

Please refer to [avoid-high-cardinality](avoid-high-cardinality "mention")

## Invalid Label Name

If your metric or label name contains invalid character or conflicts with system reserved labels, processor will stop running. Please update and re-upload

## Regular Processor Error

If you observe an error, it is always possible to use [debug-processors](debug-processors "mention")to help with the debugging.

## Ethers Error

When you do ethers call in your processor, it's very easy to produce errors. You could check the following list for possible causes:

* You are using the wrong address for the contract, you could do `try catch`  and `console.log` the address and then verify on the blockchain explorer
*  You are calling to chains other than Ethereum mainnet, the get contract view function has a default chain parameter, e.g.\
  `getERC721Contract(address: string, network: EthChainId.ETHEREUM)`\
  you need to specific network parameters for other chains, the list of chain id could be imported at 

  ```typescript
  import { EthChainId } from "@sentio/sdk/eth";
  ```
* Using the wrong block number to call, when calling the view function, the default block number are the following, it's common that call fail for certain block, contact [support@sentio.xyz](mailto:support@sentio.xyz), if you still have a problem. 
  * If you are using `ctx.contract.function` then the default block number is `ctx.blockNumber` 
  * If you just call contract view outside of context, it by default `latest` 
* If it says `UNRECOGNIZED_NAME` , it's likely that you pass invalid ENS name to a field that is the address type.

 If you still have problems, feel free to [contact us](#getting-help).
