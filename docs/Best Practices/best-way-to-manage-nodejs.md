It is very common that you have multiple versions of nodejs. In this case, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the node versions.

If you have the node installed, try remove it using

```sh
brew uninstall node
```

Then you can install *nvm* instead

```sh
brew install nvm
```

Then you can follow the instructions:

> Make sure you restart the terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`

Then you can run this command to install node of a specific version

```bash
nvm install 22
```

If you have multiple versions, you can use this command to switch versions

```bash
nvm use 22
```
