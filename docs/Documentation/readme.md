## Overview

Sentio provides modern **monitoring**, **alerting**, log management and debugging for decentralized applications as an ***integrated*** and **hosted** experience.

Users can use Sentioâ€™s SDK to **collect** and **transform** [metrics](metrics "mention") and [event-logs](event-logs "mention") generated based on their smart contractsâ€™ events, transactions, traces and states. Sentio fully manages the indexing process, and users can visualize and set up [alerts](alerts "mention") on the metrics and perform advanced search on the logs, all via Sentioâ€™s web interface. Users can further dig into a transaction via [Overview](overview "mention").
