## Permission levels

There are 3 types of permission levels for a project

<br />

| Role         | Capabilities                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Admin        | Can edit the project and access |
| Collaborator | Can edit the project            |
| Viewer       | Can only view dashboard         |

### Project visibility

There are two types of visibility for a project, Public access or Private.

`Public access` means everyone, including guest visitors who have not signed up, will have `Viewer` access to the dashboard of the project. This setting is typically used when you want to share the dashboards you created publicly via social media or blogs.

**You can share the dashboard to the public by simply copy and paste the URL of the dashboard**

`Private access` means only Admin and Collaborator can edit and view the project.

### Collaborators

You can add Collaborators to your project in the `Collaborators` sub tab by adding either their email or username. Once a user is added as a collaborator, the shared project will also appear in their project selector.
