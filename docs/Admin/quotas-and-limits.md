## How the usage of multi-version is computed?

If you enabled multi-version (say the 2 versions are *X* and *Y, X being the new version*), the backfill stage is always free. Once version *X* reaches the state of **Watching,** the Sentio units usage of both *X* and *Y* will be counted until you switch to the active version to *X.* (then the usage of *Y* will no longer be counted). Similarly, if you abandon version *X*, then the usage of *X* will no longer be counted.
