The logs are available from Sentio UI. It contains all the Deposit Event we submitted from [submitting-event-logs](submitting-event-logs "mention")

If you'd like to do a range search on Amount between **1000 and 10000** submitted from [#submit-attributes](submitting-event-logs#submit-attributes "mention"), you could easily do this from the UI:
