Sentio allows users to work with different chains through different APIs. In this section, we give brief example of how to leverage Sentio APIs on different chains. Current we support four types of chains:

* [evm-chains](evm-chains/ "mention")
* [aptos](aptos/)
* [SUI chains](doc:sui)
* [Starknet](doc:starknet)
* [Fuel chains](doc:fuel)
