Generally, users write [processors](processor-basic) to work with certain blockchain transactions, events, traces, account resources and time/block/version intervals, etc.

Then users can add custom logic to transform the data, [submitting-metrics](submitting-metrics "mention"), [submitting-event-logs](submitting-event-logs "mention"),

[send-events-via-webhook](send-events-via-webhook "mention").

Processors are **triggered** by user-defined conditions (for **both backfill and real time following**).

Users can visualize the data from [Sentio UI](https://app.sentio.xyz/).
