The core concept of a Sentio project is **Processor**. A processor is usually a typescript project that contains logic to use blockchain data to generate **user-defined data** to sentio. The processor should be written using Sentio's SDK framework and be submitted and run on Sentio.

While Sentio processor provides max performance and flexibility, we also support [hosted-subgraph](hosted-subgraph "mention") that still have lots of feature like SQL/GraphQL API, analytic dashboard, multi-versioning. So that you could easily run data pipeline on Sentio without writing new code.

A Sentio processor could handle multiple contracts on multiple chains. To import a contract, simple copy the contract's [ABI](abi) JSON file into `abis` directory. Run `sentio build` or `sentio gen` will generate contract processor files into the `src/types` directory. 

Then you can use the generated contract processor class to bind to an address, and add different [handlers](handlers-and-filters), the SDK also comes up with several built-in contract processors, a minimal processor example with built-in [ERC20 processor](https://sentioxyz.github.io/sentio-sdk/classes/builtin.erc20.ERC20Processor.html) is:

```typescript
import { ERC20Processor } from '@sentio/sdk/eth/builtin/erc20'

ERC20Processor.bind({ address: '0x1e4ede388cbc9f4b5c79681b7f94d36a11abebc9', network: EthChainId.ETHEREUM })
  .onEventTransfer((event, ctx) => {
    ctx.meter.Counter('token').add(event.args.value)
  }
)
```

The above code first bind ERC20 contract processor to a specific address on the ethereum mainnet (specify with `network=CHAIN_IDS.ETHEREUM`, can be omitted if just using Ethereum mainnet). Then it registers a function that handles `Transfer` event, for each of these events, we add the transfer value to a metric named `token`.

If you bring your own ABI, our codegen will automatically generate all event handler registration method in a typesafe way as well.
